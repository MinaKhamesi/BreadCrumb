# Breadcrumb queston

- a breadcrumb on top of the page shows the current location
- each section on breadcrumb is clickable. clicking on items will take user to that folder
- the content of current location is showing on the page, and by clicking on the items, user can navigate through our directory tree
- a very simple server is in place with a single GET /path/:givenpath route. since it was very simple server, I included our only route in the server.js itself.
